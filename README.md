# ptmatch

This project is an implementation of the services described in [Patient Matching Test Harness Interface](http://mitre.github.io/test-harness-interface/).
It provides the REST/JSON based services to handle the management of record matching system entries, test data sets and matching runs.

This project builds on the [Intervention Engine FHIR Server](https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir) for all FHIR services. A web
based user interface for this project is provided in the [Patient Match Frontend Project](https://github.com/mitre/ptmatch-frontend).

## Environment

This project currently uses Go 1.7 and is built using the Go toolchain.

To install Go, follow the instructions found at the [Go Website](http://golang.org/doc/install).

Following standard Go practices, you should clone this project to:

    $GOPATH/src/github.com/mitre/ptmatch

Assuming your working directory is $GOPATH/src/github.com/mitre, the git command will look like:

    git clone https://github.com/mitre/ptmatch.git

This project uses [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to manage dependencies. To get all of
the needed run:

    go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
    glide install

To run all of the tests for this project, run:

    go test $(glide novendor)

in this directory.

This project also requires MongoDB 3.2.* or higher. To install MongoDB, refer to the
[MongoDB installation guide](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

To start the application, simply run main.go:

    go run main.go

You can also run the application with the assets flag to serve static assets:

    go run main -assets PATH_TO_ASSETS

In this case, PATH_TO_ASSETS should be a location where a version  
[Patient Match Frontend](https://github.com/mitre/ptmatch-frontend) has been built.

## HEART authentication and authorization:

This server has the ability to authenticate users by acting as a [HEART](http://openid.net/wg/heart/)
compliant OpenID Connect relying party. It can also perform OAuth 2.0 token
introspection in a HEART compliant manner. To enable it, the following command
line flags must be used:

    -heartJWK - The path to the client's private key in [JWK format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). The
                public key must be registered at the OpenID Connect Provider
    -heartOP - The URL of the HEART compliant OpenID Connect Provider
    -heartClientID - The client identifier for this system as registered at the OpenID Connect Provider
